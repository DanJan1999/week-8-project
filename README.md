Video Tutorial Script:

8 Ball is a virtual way to experience the classic Magic 8 ball toy we all know and love!

Using 8 Ball is as intuitive as you would think it is. First navigate to *link*.

Once there you will see everything displayed in an easy to read, well organized display.

As your eyes move down the screen, you come accross a set of instructions for use.

Simply follow these instructions in order to use 8 Ball and know what to expect out of it!

*Read instructions one by one.*

Before we try it out, here is how 8 Ball works,

When 8 Ball is clicked, he first reads your question. If you haven't typed anything, you are asked to typ ein your question.

If you have typed a question, when clicked, 8 Ball will shake, allowing the magic dice in his core to roll.

As the dice settles in 8 Ball's display, the answer to your question appears.

With the classic Magic 8 Ball, that's all there is too it! BUT,

with 8 Ball, that's not the final word. Actually, it IS the final word. BECAUSE

when 8 Ball reads your question, he stores it, along with the response he gives you! And if you try

to ask that same question again, he will simply provide you with the same response as before! No asking until you get the 

answer you want!

The only exception to this rule is if your answer is "neutral" meaning you get something like "Ask again later"

If this is the case, 8 Ball does not store the question, allowing it to be asked again until a "positive" or "negative" answer is given.

Let's give it a try!
